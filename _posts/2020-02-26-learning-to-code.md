I only realised I wanted to pursue Computer Science in Year 11. I attended a Careers Expo where all the big universities promoted themselves. I took a bunch of booklets from almost every area. I really enjoyed STEM subjects in high school and I had a lot of friends that wanted to study engineering, so I first looked at the booklet for Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences. Upon a quick read, I stumbled upon the Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced), offered by the University of Adelaide, and was immediately sold. It was suggested I could "find the world's first true artificial intelligence" and that I would be able to extend my studies to an Honours degree upon completion of this program. I was very excited about this, so I put this degree as my first preference, and was ecstatic when I got accepted. What now?

Starting my first year, I knew I was going to be behind skills-wise compared to my fellow peers. Within O-Week, I listened to students nerdier than myself ask about Linux, dual-booting, Java vs. Python vs. C++, and the list goes on. Only now do I have some idea what they're talking about. My first programming language to learn was MATLAB, a bizzarre language (indexes start at 1), but quite accessible and useful to newcomers. I struggled a lot with the basics, and only started to feel comfortable with coding until at least halfway through the semester.
