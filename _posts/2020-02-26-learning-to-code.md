I only realised I wanted to pursue Computer Science in Year 11. I attended a Careers Expo where all the big universities promoted themselves. I took a bunch of booklets from almost every area. I really enjoyed STEM subjects in high school and I had a lot of friends that wanted to study engineering, so I first looked at the booklet for Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences. Upon a quick read, I stumbled upon the Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced), offered by the University of Adelaide, and was immediately sold. It was suggested I could "find the world's first true artificial intelligence" and that I would be able to extend my studies to an Honours degree upon completion of this program. I was very excited about this, so I put this degree as my first preference, and was ecstatic when I got accepted. What now?

Starting my first year, I knew I was going to be behind skills-wise compared to my fellow peers. Within O-Week, I listened to students nerdier than myself ask about Linux, dual-booting, Java vs. Python vs. C++, and the list goes on. Only now do I have some idea what they're talking about. My first programming language to learn was MATLAB, a bizzarre language (indexes start at 1), but quite accessible and useful to newcomers. I struggled a lot with the basics, and only started to feel comfortable with coding until at least halfway through the semester. 

In Semester 2, I felt much more confident coding in C++ and learning OOP for the first time. Fast forward to my summer break, I have recently completed a highly intensive study program to assist me in landing an internship during the summer of 2021-22. I have greatly improved my resume and LinkedIn, whilst spending hundreds of hours doing leetcode questions and mock interviews. I have also become familiar with a wide range of algorithms and data structures, which is knowledge I will further develop in my second year of university. I am currently applying for internship opportunities, and I am hoping an internship will expose me to the inner workings of a real software engineering team. I have come a long way since the start of university, and I look forward to what the future holds.
