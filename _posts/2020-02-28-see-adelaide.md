Mid-2020, I completed the Global IQ Connect Program, where I worked with a group of international students to learn about their backgrounds and develop my cultural intelligence. One student I met, who is from Bangladesh, approached me at the end of the program and asked if I was interested on building a tourism app for international students. He explained that during 2021, there will be a large bottleneck of students waiting to move to Adelaide due to the pandemic, and that universities will be expecting international arrivals at least three times that of their usual intake. Therefore, a tourism app specifically designed for international students living in Adelaide to search for places to visit, food to eat, Adelaide attractions and events, as well as places to meet with friends.

Following this meeting, I immediately organised a team of software developers to work on the app, and we have made significant progress on the summer break. By the end of February, we aim to have a prototype of 50 locations for students to look at within the app. For each location, we will provide a summary of the place, cost, travel, images, a map and a recommendation to visit the place. Stay posted for further updates!
